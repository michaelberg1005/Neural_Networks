## Write Up
For my neural network model I used 2 layers, with 8 neurons in the first layer and 5 neurons in the second layer. However, I was unable to fully achieve the targe model performance (I got to 72.5%). I tried to increase performance by first adding neurons to the neural network model, followed by an additional layer. When doing that started to stop improving the model I stopped adding. If I were to implement a different model to solve this classifciation problem, I would choose the SVM method, in case the model data types were non linear and due to its multiple data types (text and tabular).
